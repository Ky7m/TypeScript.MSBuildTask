# TypeScript.MSBuildTask
Installs TypeScript tools as a NuGet package and modifies the project file to use these tools. This ensures that compilation will work even on build agents that do not have these tools installed.

**Important!**
You should install the TypeScript for Visual Studio extension on your development machine, and add at least one .ts file to the project prior to installing this package.
