# TypeScript.MSBuildTask (Obsolete)
**Important!**
A long-standing request from some of our users has been to provide an official TypeScript NuGet package to improve the ease of acquisition. Starting with TypeScript 1.8 beta, they will be distributing the TypeScript compiler and the MSBuild task as a NuGet package with every release! Links to the respective packages are below:
[TypeScript compiler](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TypeScript.Compiler)
[TypeScript MSBuild task](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild)
